		<p>I've seen you around quite often <br>but never on my own screen. <br>When I got you for my 64-bit <br>I started to see how much you would mean. <br>You give me freedom to navigate <br>all I need to do is use "cd" <br>and with commands like "nano" and "touch" <br>I can edit and create files with ease. <br>You even let me add my own contents <br>with the command "mkdir" <br>and after listing my directory's files <br>"ls" made me realize we'd go far. <br>I don't worry about losing my location <br>with "pwd" I'll see right where we are. <br>"ssh" even takes me to the server <br>Bash, together we can reach the stars.</p>
